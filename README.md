# electrostatic-adhesion-plate

The motivation behind this project is that I wanted to test how strong electro-adhesion really is and what clamping force I can get myself with it. Since PCBs are very inexpensive nowadays, the choice fell on electrodes directly on a circuit board. In the first version (100x100mm) the electrode gap is not yet optimal and there are points where corona discharges are likely, this is fixed in the second version (DinA5). 

A batch (50pcs) of the seccond version is about to be ordered by me.

The boards were designed so that they can be connected to larger printed circuit boards (electrically) using solder connections. This makes it possible to build relatively large electroadhesive surfaces with relatively inexpensive printed circuit boards.

## [100mm * 100mm](100100mm/)

Rated for up to 2kV (to be tested), holding force (to be tested).
